# Benkyou Java

This is a continuation of an academic project done during the Spring 2019 semester in the VCU College of Engineering CMSC 355 - Software Engineering: Specification and Design course. I have decided to work on it on my own to fix bugs and implement features that my team was not able to get done, and hopefully, continue learning more in android development.
